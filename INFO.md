# Site deployed by Netlify

site name: visionary-yeot-82c38a

[Site](https://visionary-yeot-82c38a.netlify.app/)

I pushed to Github, but I had to trigger a depoly in Netlify. I think it should
have automatically deployed ?

In the styles section, local styles worked at first, but then it got too
complicated. with the define:vars section. (so I just dropped it)
